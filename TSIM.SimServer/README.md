## SimServer

This server runs a simulation in real time and periodically publishes snapshots (incremental/full) of the simulation state.

The complete state is made up of:

- Network Database (describes transport infrastructure; presumed to be slow-changing)
- Unit Database (describes vehicle classes, vehicle state and their plans, changes continuously)
- Simulation Information (time)

In Phase 1, Network Database is assumed immutable, so it only needs to be loaded once.

The databases are published via RabbitMQ as `SimState_full.cbor`:
- `units`
    - example: `[{"Class":{"Name":"generic","AccelMax":0,"DecelMax":0,"VelocityMax":0},"Pos":{"X":3538.2336,"Y":1769.2385,"Z":0},"Velocity":{"X":17.202816,"Y":6.3019185,"Z":0},"Orientation":{"IsIdentity":false,"X":0,"Y":0,"Z":0.17467363,"W":0.9846265}}]`
- `trainControl`
    - example: `{"0":{"schedulerState":"GOTO_NEAREST_STATION","segmentsToFollow":[{"segmentId":1,"entryEp":1,"segmentLength":54.880363,"goalT":-1},{"segmentId":32,"entryEp":0,"segmentLength":42.900234,"goalT":1}]}}`
- `simInfo`
